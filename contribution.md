What did you personally contribute to the most?
I contributed primarily to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase. 
I worked on analyzing churn patterns, interpreting feature distributions, and clearly explaining the business implications of the findings. 
I also contributed to developing actionable recommendations based on the insights uncovered during the analysis.

What is one decision or approach you personally advocated for and why?
I advocated for focusing on tree-based models like XGBoost instead of prioritizing logistic regression. 
Since this was a classification problem with potentially complex, non-linear relationships between customer features and churn behavior, I believed a gradient boosting model would better capture interactions and improve predictive performance compared to a simple linear model.

What are one or two lessons learned, and what would you improve with more time?
High model accuracy is valuable, but interpretability and actionable insights are equally important for stakeholders.

Lessons learned
Implement more extensive hyperparameter tuning and model comparison.
Develop a clearer deployment or monitoring strategy, including how the model would be updated over time.
Conduct deeper feature engineering to potentially improve predictive performance.
