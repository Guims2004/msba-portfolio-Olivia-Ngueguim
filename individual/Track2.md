**What would be implemented in 1–2 sentences?**

Customers predicted to be at high risk of churn receive a welcome call, access to guided support tutorials, and a small engagement incentive, all designed to increase early adoption of services and engagement with support resources.

**What is the success metric and what is the baseline customer churn percentage or value from your data? At the same time, what is one metric you would not want to get worse?**

The primary metric for this program is the churn rate among older month-to-month customers, with a baseline of approximately 25% within the first 90 days. The program aims to reduce this churn by increasing early engagement through welcome calls, guided tutorials, and incentives. At the same time, customer satisfaction (CSAT) should not decrease, ensuring that onboarding efforts and incentives improve perceived value without creating frustration or confusion.

**How would you measure impact and what are two risks or unintended consequences? Measurement examples are an A/B test or phased rollout etc.**

The impact of the Personalized Onboarding & Engagement Program can be measured when high-risk customers are randomly assigned to a treatment group (receives welcome calls, tutorials, and incentives) or a control group (standard onboarding). Effectiveness is evaluated by comparing churn rates and engagement with support features over the first 90 days. Two key risks include low participation, which could reduce program effectiveness, and higher operational costs from personalized calls and incentives. These can be mitigated by actively scheduling calls, automating tutorials where possible, and focusing resources on the highest-risk customers.
